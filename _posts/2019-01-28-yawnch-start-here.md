SaaS products are hot ‚Äî very hot ‚Äî so [we](https://lets-go.design/){:target="_blank"} created our own.

[Stockstream](https://stockstream.tv){:target="_blank"} is a subscription based web app birthed to solve the problem of democratizing access to financial knowledge.

Feeling the pains of building a SaaS company we abstracted sstv into an [open source framework](https://github.com/yawnch){:target="_blank"} so anyone can develop & launch their product in record time. Our goal is to provide value to early stage co-founders with varying backgrounds.

Thanks for being here with us üôè come hang out if would like to get involved: [https://yawnch.com/](https://yawnch.com/){:target="_blank"}
